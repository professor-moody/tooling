FAQ
Why?
Many OffSec tools are shipped with their source code only and therefore need to be compiled manually. This is a very time-consuming task, especially if you want to keep your tools up to date before doing assessments. Better save the time for more important things, right?

Duhh, but you also put PowerShell scripts in releases. Why?
We don't want to rack our brains every time before an assessment about which tools we need. A release conveniently contains all the tools we need for the assessment as a collection.

Did you backdoor the tools?
No. Cross our heart and hope to die.
